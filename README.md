# Logo Generator

## Description

This is a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. It prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated image. 

This project:
- streamlines creating simple logo images.
- allowed me to practice working with command line applications as well as making tests.
- reinforced the idea that there isn't just one "right" answer in coding.

## Usage

In the terminal type "node index" to run the application.<br>
